# User Guide — LLM-Wiki Memory System

How to actually work with this system in **your** tools. After one-time
setup, the system maintains itself.

For the canonical structure reference (paths, env vars, zones), see
[STRUCTURE.md](STRUCTURE.md). For the design rationale, see
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). For the agent operating contract, see
`../AGENTS.md` (root agent contract, byte-identical to `CLAUDE.md`).

---

## The mental model in one paragraph

Agents read and act on the vault through the local MCP server. Thin native
hooks/plugins forward lifecycle events that MCP cannot observe through
`integration_adapter.py`. The system decides what's worth remembering, saves
it as Markdown, and compiles in the background. SessionStart health is quiet
when healthy and injects only degraded/error findings.

**The LLM part**: the system needs a "brain" to read transcripts and decide
what to keep. That brain is **whichever agent you're already using** — the
`llm_client.py` abstraction auto-detects the first alive backend
(OpenCode → Codex → Claude CLI → OpenAI → Ollama). **No extra API keys
required** beyond what you already have; Ollama is an optional local backend.

Backend disclosure:

| Backend | Processing boundary |
|---------|---------------------|
| OpenCode | LLM Wiki calls a loopback OpenCode server; the selected OpenCode model may use a remote service. |
| Codex / Claude | LLM Wiki invokes a local CLI; the CLI may use its account's remote service. |
| OpenAI | Prompts are sent to the configured HTTPS API. |
| Ollama | The configured Ollama endpoint is used. A remote endpoint or cloud model is not local processing. |

All first-party calls pass through the fail-closed model boundary. Built-in secret
detectors are always active. `LLM_WIKI_DLP_POLICY`, when set, must name an absolute,
regular UTF-8 JSON file containing exactly `version`, `literals`,
`allow_fingerprints`, and `sha256`. The digest is SHA-256 of canonical JSON for the
first three fields. Literals are fixed strings, not regular expressions; fingerprints
allow only one exact payload. A missing, unreadable, invalid, oversized, or
digest-mismatched required policy blocks model transport and publication.

For the strict Ollama path, disable cloud in the Ollama server, restart it, and force
the provider and a literal loopback IP:

```bash
export MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
export OLLAMA_NO_CLOUD=1
export MEMORY_LLM_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1
```

```powershell
$env:MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER = "ollama"
$env:OLLAMA_NO_CLOUD = "1"
$env:MEMORY_LLM_BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1"
```

This disables provider fallback, rejects non-literal-loopback endpoints, and requires
the selected model to appear in `/api/tags` with local size/digest metadata and no
`remote_model` or `remote_host`. The descriptor still reports
`external_runtime_unverified`: the client cannot prove that an independently managed
Ollama process was restarted with cloud disabled. Do not describe this state as
verified network isolation.

---

## One-time setup

### Option A: Local installer from an inspected checkout (recommended)

Install `uv` from https://docs.astral.sh/uv/ first — version **0.12.3 exactly**, which is
what `pyproject.toml` requires and what both installers and every CI job pin; any other
version is refused with the upgrade command. The installer does not execute a mutable remote
dependency bootstrap.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ekgardt/llm-wiki.git
cd llm-wiki
LLM_WIKI_ROOT="$(pwd)" bash ./install.sh
```

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Ekgardt/llm-wiki.git
Set-Location llm-wiki
$env:LLM_WIKI_ROOT = (Get-Location).Path
.\install.ps1
```

Remote bootstrap accepts only a full 40-hex `LLM_WIKI_COMMIT`. It fetches that exact
commit into a new `~/LLM-wiki`, verifies `HEAD`, repository identity, and required files,
then executes the checked-out installer. Branches and tags are rejected. The verified
commit becomes the local `main` branch tracking `origin/main`, so the nightly fast-forward
reaches this vault like a cloned one; `git -C ~/LLM-wiki checkout --detach` freezes it, and
the nightly report then says `skipped (detached_head)`. Existing
checkouts retain all remote settings unless `--protect-push` or `-ProtectPush` is explicit.
The installer detects agents. It configures OpenCode, Codex, and Claude only when their
configuration verifies.
Obsidian is the reading surface, never a requirement: when `knowledge/.obsidian/`
already exists, the install places the claims-ledger CSS snippet there (see
[Reading the memory in Obsidian](#reading-the-memory-in-obsidian)).

### Installed-vault reliability check

Run the shared installed-vault validator without mutation:

```bash
uv run --locked --no-sync python scripts/repair_installed_memory.py --check --json
```

The check performs bounded reads and does not create `run/`, change Git, or delete
knowledge, operational state, retired databases, legacy caches, tombstones, or
compatibility markers. It reports Reliability V3 fresh, upgrade-required, partial,
adopted, and conflict evidence in a closed JSON envelope.

The offline apply gate (`--apply --adopt-ownership-v3 --confirm-all-agents-stopped`)
performs the cutover on a fresh, upgrade-required, or partly adopted vault, and resumes an
interrupted one. The installer runs it by itself only on a fresh vault, where no earlier
queue exists that a running agent could be writing. On a vault that already holds the
earlier queue, close every agent session and either rerun the installer with
`--confirm-all-agents-stopped` (PowerShell `-ConfirmAllAgentsStopped`) or run the command
above; the flag is your statement, not something the installer can check for you. Never
remove v2 state by hand.

### Option B: Manual setup

1. **Clone + install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ekgardt/llm-wiki.git
   cd llm-wiki
   uv sync --locked --extra mcp-server
   uv run pytest -q          # inspect the current full regression status
   ```

2. **Set environment variables** (add to your shell profile):
   ```bash
   export LLM_WIKI_ROOT="$(pwd)"
   export LLM_WIKI_STATE_ROOT="$LLM_WIKI_ROOT"   # runtime inside vault
   ```
   ```powershell
   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("LLM_WIKI_ROOT", "$(Get-Location)", "User")
   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("LLM_WIKI_STATE_ROOT", "$(Get-Location)", "User")
   ```

3. **Create runtime dirs** (gitignored, regenerated on demand):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p cache logs run
   ```

4. **Wire up your agents** (see below).

### Wire up your agents

| Agent | How to wire |
|-------|-------------|
| **Claude Code** | Configure MCP for reads/actions; the installer's ownership transaction writes the thin lifecycle hooks into `~/.claude/settings.json` and takes them back on uninstall. |
| **OpenCode** | Configure MCP, then copy `scripts/llm-wiki-memory-opencode.js` for lifecycle events. |
| **Codex CLI** | Configure MCP; on Windows add `. "$env:LLM_WIKI_ROOT\scripts\codex-memory-wrapper.ps1"` to `$PROFILE` for lifecycle capture. |
| **Obsidian** | Optional reading surface: open `knowledge/` as the vault. Agents never need it. |

### Reading the memory in Obsidian

Open `knowledge/` as an Obsidian vault. Links are bare `[[slug]]` names, and
Obsidian derives backlinks itself. Every note ends with a claims ledger: a
`## Claims` heading followed by a one-line `json` block that the product reads.
Search does not index it: a note is found by its prose and its evidence lines.
The snippet `llm-wiki-claims-ledger.css` collapses it so the note reads as prose.

When `knowledge/.obsidian/` exists, `install.sh` and `install.ps1` copy the
snippet to `knowledge/.obsidian/snippets/llm-wiki-claims-ledger.css`. They never
create `.obsidian/`: open the vault in Obsidian once, then rerun the installer.
A rerun leaves an up-to-date snippet as it is, and an uninstall removes it. The
source is `integrations/obsidian/llm-wiki-claims-ledger.css`; copying it by hand
works too.

Enable it once: **Settings → Appearance → CSS snippets**, press the reload
button, and switch on `llm-wiki-claims-ledger`.

- **Reading view:** the heading is faint and the ledger shrinks to one dim row.
  Hover it to read it in full.
- **Live preview:** the ledger line is clipped to one dim row until the cursor
  enters it. The editor does not expose heading text to CSS, so the rule matches
  the ledger's shape: a level-2 heading followed directly by a one-line code
  block. Another note section with that exact shape is dimmed the same way.
- **Source mode** is left as it is.

The same managed hooks also put the code graph where agents search (issue #24):
a `Grep`/`Glob` in Claude Code, or an `rg`/`grep` in Codex, whose pattern names a
symbol of an indexed repository gets a three-line hint naming its definitions and
`mcp__llm-wiki__get_architecture`; a subagent start and a session start get one
line naming the code tools. The OpenCode plugin appends the hint to its
`grep`/`glob` output. Nothing is added for unindexed checkouts, literals or file
globs, and a hook never blocks or fails a tool call. See
[Code Navigation](CODE-NAVIGATION.md#graph-context-where-the-agent-searches-issue-24-section-c).

Managed IDE hooks preserve unrelated configuration and use verified sibling preimages.
Malformed configuration, ownership conflicts, or drift fail closed instead of being
overwritten. `doctor` reports active, absent, or conflicting structural ownership and
never repairs these files implicitly.

The MCP server exposes 13 task-shaped tools, including `doctor`. All tools use
one response envelope, and health/context are also available as MCP resources.

### Exact 13-tool contract

`manage_project` joined the twelve earlier tools with the project map (Stage 2 of
the readable-memory spec). These are the implemented behaviors in the integrated
Tasks 1-29 branch, not the broader Task 17 target:

| Tool | Current behavior |
|---|---|
| `recall` | Routes search through the retrieval planner. Result rows expose requested/effective mode, actual signals, generation, reranker fields, and fallback reason. The requested result limit is clamped to 1-20. |
| `read_page` | Reads one bounded slug-only Markdown page and resolves cited daily/archive evidence with source hashes. Evidence failure fails the page read closed. |
| `wiki_overview` | Reports page count, recommended retrieval tier, and vault root. It does not yet provide per-component generation health. |
| `vault_status` | Reports compile timestamp/status and changed-daily backlog only. |
| `get_decisions` | Uses the same retrieval path, filters active decision results, emits bounded telemetry, and clamps limits to 1-20. |
| `get_context` | Remains the bounded 1-20 slug batch with optional compatibility `content_preview`. The planned token-budgeted repo/symbol/evidence package is **evidence pending**. |
| `check_contradiction` | Returns structured assessments, evidence, validity, and lifecycle recommendations; unsupported evidence is quarantined rather than treated as verified. |
| `log_decision` | Appends through the locked daily-log writer; it does not directly publish a durable decision page. |
| `compile` | Requests the existing non-blocking, single-lock background compile. |
| `find_dead_code` | Queries the active Evidence Graph first and reports source generation, graph completeness, unresolved count, and fallback. `live=true` explicitly bypasses the store. |
| `get_architecture` | Keeps structural `summary`, `symbol`, `callers`, `callees`, `dependencies`, `path`, `community`, and `impact`; adds `search` (ranked qualified names with degree), `snippet` by `owner.name` with exact stored line ranges, `coverage` with the parse ranges the extractor could not read, `depth` on `callers`/`callees`, and `affected_symbols` on `impact` (#24, B); precise Python `definition`, `references`, `implementations`, `type`, `diagnostics`, and positioned call modes use the owned Pyright session. |
| `doctor` | Exposes nine closed actions: `status`, queue inspect/cancel/redrive/dead-list, transaction recover/undo, archive status, and claim status. Mutation actions require `repair=true`. |
| `manage_project` | Edits the private project map through the Markdown transaction API with six closed actions: `create` (`name`, optional `directory`), `attach` (`name`, `directory`), `detach` (`directory`), `rename` (`name`, `new_name`), `remove` (`name`), and `list`. A refused request answers with a stable `code` such as `unknown_project`, `project_exists`, `reserved_name` or `not_a_repository`. See [Registering a project](#registering-a-project). |

All responses retain JSON text compatibility and the common envelope. Structured MCP
output is used when the installed SDK supports it. The envelope's top-level
`index_timestamp` is null and its freshness comes from the per-component generation
fields; the legacy index it once read was retired on 2026-09-23. Treat row-level
generation and fallback fields as the current retrieval truth.

## Repository indexes follow your worktrees

Index a repository once (`get_architecture mode=index`, or
`uv run python scripts/repository_index.py index <checkout>`). From then on its
other worktrees are indexed without you: the nightly pass indexes up to eight
new ones, and the first `get_architecture` answer in a new worktree starts its
index in the background. The nightly pass also retires what nobody reads: every
generation of a worktree whose directory is gone, and all but the newest two of
a live one (`repository_index.py retire --dry-run` shows the plan).

To keep a one-off branch or worktree out of the index, mark it in Git:

```bash
git config branch.my-one-off.llmwikiIndex false   # one branch
git config llmwiki.index false                    # the whole repository
```

A marked checkout is refused by name and its existing generations are retired on
the next nightly pass. Details:
[Code Navigation](CODE-NAVIGATION.md#worktrees-and-retention-issue-24-section-d1).

## Read-only Python code navigation

Precise navigation uses four pinned managed language servers through the existing
`get_architecture` MCP tool: **Pyright 1.1.411** for Python,
**typescript-language-server 6.0.0** (tsserver 5.9.3) for TypeScript and
JavaScript, **gopls v0.23.0** for Go and **rust-analyzer 1.98.1** for Rust. The file
suffix chooses the server; a suffix none of them claims degrades to structural
evidence. Install each managed package explicitly:

```bash
uv run python scripts/install_pyright.py --state-root "$LLM_WIKI_STATE_ROOT"
uv run python scripts/install_language_server.py --profile typescript --state-root "$LLM_WIKI_STATE_ROOT"
uv run python scripts/install_language_server.py --profile gopls --state-root "$LLM_WIKI_STATE_ROOT"
uv run python scripts/install_language_server.py --profile rust-analyzer --state-root "$LLM_WIKI_STATE_ROOT"
```

No query, doctor check, or profile discovery path downloads or updates a server.
The precise modes are `mode=definition`, `mode=references`,
`mode=implementations`, `mode=type`, and `mode=diagnostics`; positioned
`callers` and `callees` also use a managed server. Input lines are one-based and
character values are zero-based UTF-8 byte offsets. Structural modes retain their
existing 10-second deadline; precise modes use one absolute 60-second deadline.

This feature supports **trusted local repositories** only. It is not an OS sandbox.
A managed server runs with the current user's permissions and may read configured
interpreters, external stubs, toolchains, and libraries. Windows uses a Job Object
for the assigned process tree. POSIX uses a process group while descendants remain in
that group; hostile `setsid()` escape is unsupported.

Every result binds pre/post workspace revisions and current source citations. One
stale attempt is retried once. There is no semantic result cache, no query-time graph
publication, and no complete-negative promise. See
[CODE-NAVIGATION.md](CODE-NAVIGATION.md) for status semantics, exact bounds, doctor
codes, and qualification evidence.

### Register scheduled maintenance

The installers publish profile/environment, scheduler, detected agent
hook fragments, and the Obsidian snippet (only when `knowledge/.obsidian/` exists)
through one resumable `run/install/` ownership transaction. Version 2
keeps the pre-first-install projection for uninstall and one latest committed update
projection for explicit rollback. Recovery uses persisted historical definitions, not
the current checkout templates. Rerun the native installer to reconcile owned state;
do not edit generated task, plist, unit, or owned hook definitions in place.

Inspect the control-plane state without mutation:

```bash
uv run --locked --no-sync python scripts/install_control.py status --state-root "${LLM_WIKI_STATE_ROOT:-$LLM_WIKI_ROOT}"
```

The `rollback` and `uninstall` subcommands require the same root, state root, home,
profile or PowerShell path, and `uv` executable used by the installer. They restore an
owned projection only when the current value still matches the installed value; drift
blocks mutation. Run `uv run python scripts/install_control.py rollback --help` or
`uninstall --help` for the platform-specific arguments.

**Windows (Task Scheduler):**
```powershell
.\install.ps1
```
Creates `LLMWiki-Nightly` (daily 03:00) and `LLMWiki-Weekly` (Sunday 04:00).

**macOS (per-user LaunchAgent) and Linux (user systemd):**
```bash
bash ./install.sh
```

Linux requires an available user systemd manager. On a host without one, cron is an
explicit degraded fallback and is never selected silently:
```bash
bash ./install.sh --scheduler cron
```

---

## What happens automatically — and when

```
REAL-TIME (while you work)
  Every Edit/Write/Bash → breadcrumb appended to today's daily log
  SessionStart → load project handoff + drain queue + background compile

END OF SESSION (agent idle or you close)
  A redacted copy of the session is written to knowledge/raw/sessions/<date>/
  LLM classifies transcript → FLUSH_MAJOR / FLUSH_MINOR / FLUSH_OK
  MAJOR/MINOR content → structured summary appended to daily log
  MAJOR triggers background compile (detached, doesn't block you)

NIGHTLY 03:00 (scheduler, subject to the operating-system login policy)
  Drain deferred queue → consolidate yesterday's session records into the daily
  log → compile all pending → structural lint → rebuild the
  FTS index → refresh the immutable evidence generation (and its vectors) →
  fetch any missing pinned model weights → compact retrieval telemetry →
  prune old reports → fast-forward the checkout

The fast-forward brings new code in; it does not bring everything into force. Optional
extras are never upgraded unattended (the `reranker` extra alone pins gigabytes), and owned
resources — scheduler entries, agent hook blocks, shell profile lines — are written only by
an explicit install. So when the update moves `uv.lock` the report names the extras you have
installed, and when it changes what the installer renders it says `owned resources
rerun_installer`. Resync an extra with `uv sync --locked --no-default-groups --inexact
--extra <name>`, and re-render owned resources by running the installer again.

SUNDAY 04:00 (scheduler)
  Everything nightly does + OKF conformance sweep + archive stale + prune failed queue tasks
  + consolidate each note with two or more updates into one page: the old prose goes
  into a collapsed History block, the note ends with its one Claims ledger, and
  decisions and retired notes are never rewritten
```

Windows tasks run only while the current user is logged on. macOS LaunchAgents use
the same login-scoped policy.
`StartWhenAvailable` runs a missed Windows task after the machine wakes and the user
signs in; it does not run under a logged-out account. Linux user-systemd timers use
persistent catch-up after the user manager starts. The product does not claim
wake-from-sleep or logged-out execution. Explicit cron fallback follows the host's
cron and sleep policy.
When a night is missed entirely, the next session start asks for it: the maintenance
pass a session start already spawns runs that day's nightly once, claimed in
`run/state.json` so two sessions cannot both run it.

Two of the four backends can kill a pass that overruns: the systemd timer carries
`TimeoutStartSec` and the Windows task an `ExecutionTimeLimit`, 3 hours nightly and 5 hours
weekly. A macOS LaunchAgent and a cron line have no such limit — launchd's `ExitTimeOut`
bounds only how long it waits after asking a job to stop — so there a hung pass ends when its
maintenance lease is reclaimed, not on a clock. The scheduler's own log
(`logs/scheduled-*.log`, `logs/cron-*.log`) is kept by the same retention as the maintenance
reports: 30 days, 60 files, 32 MB per family.

If the LLM is offline, work is queued
in `run/queue.sqlite3` and drained by a short-lived worker at the next session.

---

## Working with the system day-to-day

### Asking questions about your knowledge

```bash
uv run python scripts/search_memory.py "how do we handle auth?"
uv run python scripts/search_memory.py "database performance" --no-semantic
uv run python scripts/search_memory.py --project my-app "decisions"
uv run python scripts/query_memory.py "why did we choose Postgres?" --file-back
```

`search_memory.py` reads the active evidence generation first and falls back
to the legacy BM25 index. Vectors are on by default when the optional model is
available; `--no-semantic` turns them off. Graph-neighbor fusion applies only
when graph evidence is available. If optional signals are unavailable, search
returns the lexical result instead of claiming triple-fusion.
`query_memory.py` asks the LLM to answer from the knowledge index and
optionally files the answer as a Q&A page.

The memory index holds `knowledge/` only. The product's own `scripts/`,
`docs/` and `tests/` are not in it (they once were 92 % of an installed
vault's chunks and outranked the user's pages). Code questions go through
`get_architecture`, which reads a directory or a repository index.

```bash
uv run python scripts/repository_index.py index /path/to/repo     # build and register
uv run python scripts/repository_index.py detect /path/to/repo    # what changed since
uv run python scripts/repository_index.py refresh /path/to/repo   # rebuild only if stale
uv run python scripts/repository_index.py refresh-all             # every registered repo
uv run python scripts/repository_index.py list
uv run python scripts/code_graph.py /path/to/repo --callers NAME  # from the index; --live re-parses
```

Over MCP, `get_architecture` answers the code questions an agent asks in the
loop, all from the repository's generation (see `docs/CODE-NAVIGATION.md`):

| question | call |
|---|---|
| which symbols are named like this, ranked | `mode=search`, `symbol="find_*"`, optional `path="scripts/"`, `limit` |
| the exact source of one symbol | `mode=snippet`, `symbol="scripts.code_graph.find_callers"` |
| is this file indexed, fresh, and parsed | `mode=coverage`, `path="scripts/code_graph.py"` |
| who calls this, up to N hops | `mode=callers`, `symbol=NAME`, `depth=3` (also `callees`) |
| what does my uncommitted diff touch | `mode=impact` — `changed_symbols` and `affected_symbols` |

Structural code answers are read from a reader that is validated once per
MCP process and reused (warm `callers` on a 1 000-file repository: ~40 ms),
and each answer carries a `freshness` block naming the commit its generation
was built from and the commit the checkout is at. When they differ the
bounded incremental refresh starts in the background; the answer you get is
from the generation the vault has, and the next answer sees the new one. The
nightly pass refreshes every registered repository. See
`docs/CODE-NAVIGATION.md`.

### Registering a project

A project is a product you are building, and it may span several repositories (a
backend, a frontend, shared services). Only projects you register exist. Register
one by asking the agent you are already talking to, from Claude Code, Codex or
OpenCode alike:

- "I'm starting project Product A here, add it to the memory." The agent calls
  `manage_project` with `action=create`, `name="Product A"` and its working
  directory, so the project is created with the current repository in it.
- "This repository belongs to Product A." → `action=attach`. A repository that
  already belongs to another project is moved, and the answer says from where.
- "Detach this repository", "rename Product A to Product B", "remove Product A" →
  `detach`, `rename`, `remove`. "Which projects do I have?" → `list`.

A subfolder or a worktree registers its repository's main checkout. A directory in
no git repository cannot join a project. Names are stored as folder-safe slugs
(`Product A` becomes `product-a`); `general` is reserved for notes without a
project.

The registrations live in one private file, `knowledge/projects/project-map.md`,
that you can also edit in Obsidian:

```markdown
## product-a

- C:/work/backend
- C:/work/frontend
```

Prose, blank lines, either slash and trailing slashes are fine, and edits made
through the tool keep what you wrote around the entries. `doctor` reports the
entries it cannot use: a duplicate project, a repository listed in two projects,
a path that does not exist or is not a repository's main checkout, and the
reserved name.

Each registered repository keeps its work state, what agents were last doing
there, in `knowledge/projects/<project>/<repository>/`: an append-only `journal.md`
and the `state.md` generated from it, which session start hands to the next agent.
Work in a directory that belongs to no registered repository (web research, file
chores) creates nothing under `knowledge/projects/`; it is still captured into the
daily log and compiled as before, and its daily entries name no project.

A note the compile creates carries `project: "<project>"` in its frontmatter when
its evidence comes from a registered repository, so search can filter by project.
The compile reads it from the cited daily entries (a capture's `Repository:` line,
a breadcrumb's `<project>/<repository>` tag) through the project map as it is at
compile time, never from the model: a repository moved to another project files its
new notes there, and one no longer in the map gives none. When the evidence spans
several projects, the note takes the one most cited entries name; entries from
unregistered work count as a side of their own, and a tie gives no project. An
update never changes a note's `project:`, so an existing one stays as it is and a
note without one does not gain it.

The folders follow the map. Attaching a repository to another project moves its
folder, renaming a project moves the project's folder, and detaching a repository
or removing a project deletes its work state. Your notes are never touched. Each
change is one transaction, and the tool's answer names it: you can undo it for two
days with the `doctor` tool (`action=transaction-undo`, `repair=true`, the
transaction id). The emptied folders are removed once that window has passed.

### Reading a project in Obsidian

Each registered project has a page, `knowledge/projects/<project>/index.md`: open
it to read what the memory knows about that product. It lists the project's live
notes grouped by type (decisions first, then patterns, debugging, concepts and Q&A,
then any other type), each as a link with its one-sentence summary; the module tags
those notes use, with a count; and, for each repository, its main checkout, a link
to its work state, the branch, the current task and any open blockers. Superseded
and archived notes are not listed, so every decision you see is current.
`knowledge/projects/general/index.md` lists the notes that belong to no registered
project the same way.

The pages are generated: do not edit them, your edits are replaced. They are
rewritten after every compile, after every project registration change, and every
night, which also catches notes you edited by hand and work state that changed
since. Renaming a project renames the `project:` of every note that names it, in
the same undoable change, so they stay on its page; a note whose frontmatter cannot
be rewritten safely is named in the answer and shows on the General page. Removing a
project leaves its notes as they are: they keep their `project:` and show on the
General page, and the answer says so. The pages are private, like your notes.

### Moving to registered projects (one-off)

Before the project map, every directory an agent worked in got its own flat
`knowledge/projects/<slug>/` folder: subfolders, worktrees, scratch directories, the
home directory. Nothing reads those folders any more. One command, in three steps,
turns the ones that name a real repository into registered projects and removes the
rest:

```bash
uv run --locked --no-sync python scripts/migrate_projects.py --propose   # 1. write the proposals
uv run --locked --no-sync python scripts/migrate_projects.py             # 2. dry run: writes nothing
uv run --locked --no-sync python scripts/migrate_projects.py --apply     # 3. apply them
```

1. `--propose` resolves the roots each old folder recorded to their repository's
   main checkout (a subfolder or a worktree names its repository; a root that no
   longer exists or is in no git repository names none) and writes two private files
   for you to edit in Obsidian, each starting with `approved: false` in its
   frontmatter:
   - `knowledge/projects/project-map.proposed.md`, in the project map's format: one
     project per repository the map does not register yet, named after its folder.
     Rename a project, move a bullet under another heading to group repositories
     into one product, or delete a bullet to leave a repository unregistered.
   - `knowledge/projects/note-projects.proposed.md`: one `- <note>: <project>` line
     per live note (`-` for none) with the reason. The daily entries a note's
     evidence cites decide, as the compile does: the project most of them name wins,
     and a split gives none. Without a winner, a project whose name starts the
     note's slug is proposed. Change the project after the colon; a note that
     already carries a project is listed for reference and never changed.

   It refuses to replace proposals that already exist; `--force` proposes again.
2. The dry run shows the map that will be written, `KEEP` or `DELETE` with the
   reason for every old folder, the notes that get `project:`, the checkpoint queue
   keys it will clear from `run/state.json`, and any proposal not approved yet, then
   lists the folders to be deleted. It writes nothing. When you agree with a
   proposal, change its `approved: false` to `approved: true` in Obsidian.
3. `--apply` requires both proposals, and refuses, writing nothing, until both say
   `approved: true`. It prints the deletion list again (to stderr with `--json`,
   which also carries it in the report), then in one transaction adds the proposed
   repositories to the map (a repository the map already registers stays where it
   is), moves each kept journal to `knowledge/projects/<project>/<repository>/` with
   its `state.md` generated again, deletes every other old folder, writes `project:`
   onto the assigned notes that have none, and removes the two proposals. It prints
   the transaction id: `uv run --locked --no-sync python
   scripts/markdown_transaction.py undo <id>` within the 2-day undo window restores
   the Markdown files it changed (the project map, the notes, the moved and deleted
   journals and states, the proposals) and the blackboard streams it deleted. It
   does not restore the checkpoint queue keys cleared from `run/state.json`, or the
   non-Markdown leftovers (unfinished atomic writes) removed after the transaction.
   After two days the deletion is permanent. Running it again finds nothing to
   migrate.

An old folder is any folder under `knowledge/projects/` that is not a registered
project's, not `general` and not `_template`, and holds at least one file, whatever
it holds: a flat journal, only a `context.md`, or only a `.blackboard/` (the
append-only coordination streams `scripts/blackboard.py` writes). Apply deletes its
Markdown files and its blackboard streams in the transaction, and its unfinished
atomic writes after it. A blackboard whose project still holds a live claim, or
whose claims cannot be read, is kept, because that claim may still write to it.
Anything else the migration does not know, such as another kind of file, a Markdown
file in a subfolder or a link, is kept too, and the dry run and the apply report
name it: "kept because it holds `<files>`". The emptied directories themselves stay
for the two-day undo window, because an undo puts files back into the directories
they left, and the next project edit after that removes them.

When several old folders name one repository, the one with the most events moves
and the others are deleted: a journal is named by the key its events carry and its
sequence continues from committed checkpoints, so two journals cannot be merged into
one. When the repository already keeps a journal in the new layout, all of them are
deleted. Pending checkpoint events that `run/state.json` holds for a journal no
registered repository carries can never be written; apply clears them after the
transaction, and an undo does not bring them back.

### Compiling knowledge manually

```bash
uv run python scripts/compile_memory.py              # compile changed daily logs
uv run python scripts/compile_memory.py --dry-run    # plan only, no writes
```

There is no "recompile everything": a day whose compile was committed is never
compiled again. `--all` is deprecated — still accepted, it prints one line
saying it does nothing and will be removed.

Compile runs automatically on MAJOR sessions after the hour cutoff, but you
can trigger it manually anytime. The pipeline uses VERIFY-BEFORE-WRITE —
the LLM cannot fabricate citations.

The writer and the reviewer both read a catalog of every live note: one line
per note with its slug, title, one-sentence summary, type, and its `project:`
and `tags:` when the note has them. Superseded, archived and other retired
notes are left out. With it the model reuses an existing slug for a topic a
note already covers, and the reviewer drops a new note that repeats one. An
update adds a dated section to the note and never renames it: a slug, once
written, stays. Each summary is cut to 160 characters in the catalog; the note
itself is not changed.

Both also read the full text of up to five live notes most similar to the daily
logs being compiled, without their `## Evidence` and `## Claims` sections. The
compile asks the active evidence generation once per daily entry (hybrid search,
dense leg required) and ranks the notes several entries resemble first. The notes
are taken most similar first while they fit the context window, after the
daily-log text. The reviewer may answer that an operation is a `duplicate` of a
named note. The operation is then written as an update of that note. It is dropped
when the named slug is not a live note, or when the plan already writes that
note. Both cases are printed on stderr.

Without usable vectors the compile reads the catalog alone. That happens when there
is no active generation, its `vector_state` is `absent` or `stale`, or the
embedding model is not installed. The compile prints one line on stderr,
`compile_memory: similar notes unavailable (<reason>)`, and carries on. Lexical
matches alone are not used. Loading the model the first time costs a few seconds
per compile process. After that, each daily entry costs roughly a quarter of a
second of search.

The links the model proposes for a note, on create and on update, are kept only
when they name a live note (not superseded or otherwise retired) or a note created
in the same compile. They are written as bare `[[slug]]`; a path-style
`[[knowledge/notes/x]]` or `[[notes/x]]` becomes `[[x]]`. A note never links to
itself. An update adds its new links to the note's `## Related` section, opening
one above the `## Claims` ledger if the note has none. Every other link is
dropped, and the compile's line in `knowledge/log.local.md` names it:
`Dropped links: [[x]] (from slug-a).`

The model also tags each note with the modules it is about: areas inside a
repository, such as a service or a subsystem, never the project itself. The draft
reads the tags the live notes of each project in the batch already use, and for
work in no registered repository the tags of notes without a project; it is told
to reuse one and to create a new tag only when none fits. The compile folds each
tag to lowercase kebab-case of at most 40 characters, drops the note's own project
name and repeats, and keeps five per note. A new note gets them as
`tags: [backend, queue]`. An update appends its new tags after the note's existing
ones and never removes one; a note stops gaining tags at eight, and one whose
`tags:` is not a list is left alone. A tag that no live note of the same project
carried before is new, and the compile's log line names it:
`New tags: backend-lease (product-a), cli (no project).` The same name in two
projects counts as two tags, because it names two different modules. Tags are
never claims, so the `## Claims` ledger does not carry them.

### Compile context window

`MEMORY_COMPILE_CONTEXT_TOKENS` tells the compile how large the context window
of your model is, in tokens. The default is `32768`. Set it to the window of
the model your compile provider uses (for example `MEMORY_CODEX_MODEL`). Each
run keeps 4,000 tokens for the answer and 1,024 of slack. It then measures the
fixed prompt: system text, schema, instructions, and the note catalog. What is
left is the room for daily-log text. Similar notes take only the room the daily
logs leave over.

The catalog grows with the vault, by roughly 300 estimated tokens per live
note. It is never cut to fit: when the catalog and the instructions alone fill
the window, the compile refuses the run and names
`MEMORY_COMPILE_CONTEXT_TOKENS`, and every day stays pending until you raise it.

A long daily log is cut into pieces at entry boundaries: first 16 KiB, then
8, 4 and 2 KiB until each piece fits that room. Several pieces share one model
call when the window is large enough. Every committed piece gets its own receipt.
So a day stays compiled when you change the window, and a day that grows later
only sends its new entries.

A single entry too large for the window is deferred, not lost. The compile
prints `compile_memory: deferred <file> bytes <start>-<end>` with the window
that entry needs, and skips it for this run. It gets no receipt, so its day
stays pending and every compile retries it. Every other piece and day still
compiles in the same run. `doctor` names the deferred piece in its capture
check, with the file, its size and the value to give
`MEMORY_COMPILE_CONTEXT_TOKENS`. It is informational: it never counts as a lost
capture, and the entry disappears once a compile takes the piece.

The size is estimated as one token per UTF-8 byte. That over-counts English
text about three to four times, so the window's full size is a safe value.
A value that is not a whole number above 5,024 refuses the compile and names the
variable. It never falls back to the default without telling you.

The installers persist this variable next to the provider choice. The
scheduled nightly then uses it too. Set it in the shell you install from, then
rerun the installer:

```bash
export MEMORY_COMPILE_CONTEXT_TOKENS=272000
bash ./install.sh
```

```powershell
$env:MEMORY_COMPILE_CONTEXT_TOKENS = "272000"
.\install.ps1
```

On Windows the installer writes it to your user environment, and Task Scheduler
passes it to `LLMWiki-Nightly`. Agent sessions started after the install pick it
up too. A compile with work to do prints the window it used:
`compile_memory: N piece(s) in M batch(es) at a 272000-token context window.`

### Linting and maintenance

```bash
uv run python scripts/lint_memory.py --scope all           # 15 structural checks
uv run python scripts/lint_memory.py --contradictions      # + LLM-judged contradictions
uv run python scripts/archive_stale.py --apply           # archive old pages by type
uv run python scripts/lookup_mode.py                       # show direct/base/hybrid mode
uv run python scripts/doctor.py                            # local health; --repair is explicit
uv run --locked --no-sync python scripts/sync_memory.py --check --json  # read-only check
```

Per-project brief — the decisions, patterns and open threads of one registered
project, written to `knowledge/projects/<project>/context.md`:

```bash
uv run python scripts/build_context.py my-project           # print it
uv run python scripts/build_context.py my-project --write   # write the page
```

### Migrating existing links for Obsidian (one-off)

Notes written before bare links carry `- [[knowledge/notes/x]] — links to this page.`
lines and repository-rooted `[[knowledge/notes/x]]` links, which Obsidian (rooted at
`knowledge/`) cannot open. One command migrates them:

```bash
uv run --locked --no-sync python scripts/migrate_links.py           # dry run: lists every change
uv run --locked --no-sync python scripts/migrate_links.py --apply   # write them
uv run --locked --no-sync python scripts/migrate_links.py --json    # the report as JSON
```

It removes the backlink lines (and a `## Related` heading left empty by that), and
rewrites `[[knowledge/notes/x]]`, with or without `.md`, `|alias` or `#heading`, to a
bare `[[x]]`, and any other `[[knowledge/<path>]]` to `[[<path>]]`. A link is rewritten
only when its new form opens the file the old one named; when a shallower file of the
same name exists, the note keeps a `[[notes/x]]` path. Every link that still resolves
to nothing is listed as `UNRESOLVED` and left as it is — fix those by hand. It reads
`knowledge/notes`, `knowledge/projects`, `knowledge/inbox` and `knowledge/feedback`;
daily logs, `knowledge/raw/`, editorial pages and project journals are not touched, nor
are the `## Claims` ledger, `## Evidence` lines, code fences and inline code.

The dry run writes nothing. `--apply` writes every changed page in one recoverable
transaction and prints its id; `scripts/markdown_transaction.py undo <id>` reverts the
whole migration within the 2-day undo window. Running `--apply` again changes nothing.

### Bounded synchronization

```bash
uv run --locked --no-sync python scripts/sync_memory.py --check --json
uv run --locked --no-sync python scripts/sync_memory.py --apply --json
```

`sync_memory.py` defaults to `--check`. It reports the ordered actions
`environment`, `dependencies`, `integrations`, `transactions`, `queue`,
`indexes`, and `doctor`, each as `ok`, `changed`, `skipped`, or `error`.
Apply mode has explicit elapsed-time and action-count limits, uses the locked
MCP baseline only, repairs missing runtime directories, and rebuilds a stale
FTS index in a bounded child process. Transaction recovery and queued
flush/compile work remain diagnostic-only here; run the explicit Doctor,
transaction, or queue operator command when those actions require attention.
Sync does not install semantic, reranker, code-graph, or model dependencies,
does not run Git, and never writes under `knowledge/`.
Exit codes are stable: `0` means synchronized (`ok` or `changed`), `1` means
incomplete or degraded, and `2` means an error or invalid invocation.

## Reliable operations

Markdown remains authoritative; SQLite coordinates transactions, receipts,
derived indexes, leases, and queued work. Keep `$LLM_WIKI_STATE_ROOT` on a local
filesystem. Network filesystems are rejected. Cloud-folder detection is best-effort,
so do not place live runtime SQLite files in a synchronized folder even if no warning
appears. The current runtime uses rollback-journal, `synchronous=FULL`, and no WAL.

### Evidence generation activation and recovery

Generation publication has no in-place update. A builder captures exact source bytes
and hashes, writes and fsyncs a new directory, validates its manifest, source
membership, database schema/integrity, artifact hashes, and evidence spans, registers
it, then compare-and-swap activates it against the expected prior ID. If source
membership changes or any step fails before activation, the old generation remains
active.

Readers verify the active pointer and artifact seal around each open. A corrupt or
missing active generation is skipped; the catalog revalidates activation history and
parent lineage and repairs the pointer to the newest usable prior generation.
Recovery can register a complete immediate-child orphan, but does not activate it.
There is currently no supported end-user generation migration/status CLI: **evidence
pending**. Use `doctor` for overall runtime health and inspect MCP retrieval rows for
`generation`, `effective_mode`, `signals_used`, and `fallback_reason`.

### Legacy cache migration and safe rollback

Migration is additive and non-destructive:

1. Back up or commit authoritative Markdown and Git state as you normally would.
2. `cache/index.sqlite`, `cache/vectors.npy` and `cache/vectors_meta.json` are read
   by nothing since 2026-09-23; delete them or leave them.
3. Build and validate a generation through the integrated builder/catalog API.
4. Activate only with the expected active generation ID; a CAS mismatch means retry
   from a fresh snapshot, not overwrite.
5. Exercise lexical, optional vector, graph, code, impact, and citation reads and
   confirm their generation/fallback fields.
6. Keep the legacy caches until installed-vault migration evidence proves removal
   safe. That evidence is currently pending.

To roll back, stop active commands. Either reactivate a previously validated
generation through the catalog API or delete only `cache/evidence-graph/` and rebuild
later. Never remove `knowledge/`, `.git/`, project journals, or `run/`. With legacy
caches retained, retrieval resumes through legacy FTS/vector/Lance paths. If graph
state is absent, code tools use bounded live extraction and report `fallback=true`,
`graph_complete=false`.

Deleting all `cache/` is also knowledge-safe but removes every derived index and model
cache, so retrieval is degraded until rebuild. It does not relax the separate `run/`
deletion contract.

### Model, token, and citation labels

The model matrix pins candidate revisions and forbids a predetermined winner. A new
embedding or reranker default requires complete raw EN/RU/ZH quality and resource
measurements, license checks, no parent-recall regression, material improvement, and
Pareto efficiency. The matrix currently selects neither: **evidence pending**. The
legacy optional vector path remains a compatibility path, not proof of superiority.

Token fields must be read with their labels. `reported` comes from a provider;
`tokenizer` from a model adapter; `estimated` currently uses UTF-8 byte length;
`mixed` combines sources; `unknown` has no numeric value. Cost kind is separately
`reported`, `estimated`, or `unknown`. Do not compare estimated and reported values as
if they were equivalent measurements.

Grounded QA citations identify supplied authoritative spans by citation ID, relative
path, source hash, revision, byte/line range, and span hash. Every answered atomic
claim must cite supplied evidence. Invalid, duplicate, missing, changed, generated-
summary, or out-of-root citations fail verification. The safe outcomes are a verified
`answered` document or an explicit `insufficient_evidence`, `conflicting_evidence`,
or `unsupported_time_scope` abstention.

### Health, recovery, undo, and retention

```bash
uv run python scripts/doctor.py
uv run python scripts/doctor.py --repair
uv run python scripts/doctor.py --time-budget 60
uv run python scripts/markdown_transaction.py recover
uv run python scripts/markdown_transaction.py undo <transaction-id>
uv run python scripts/markdown_transaction.py prune --retention-days 30
```

Three one-shot repairs exist for states that defects fixed in September 2026 left
behind. A vault installed since then never meets them; an older one may, and nothing
else reclaims those bytes. Each prints what it found and changes nothing until
`--apply`:

```bash
uv run --locked --no-sync python scripts/repair_refused_appends.py        # blocks a lost append race never wrote
uv run --locked --no-sync python scripts/repair_refused_page_creation.py  # pages a refused compile never wrote
uv run --locked --no-sync python scripts/repair_exhausted_queue_tasks.py  # tasks out of attempts that still look ready
```

Recovery rolls verified prepared/applying transactions forward and quarantines a
target that matches neither its recorded before nor after hash. It never overwrites
unknown bytes. Undo creates a new forward transaction and works only while every
target still matches the original committed after-hash. Pruning removes expired
transaction images; after the 2-day undo window, or after an explicit prune, that
undo history is gone. External editors may briefly observe a mixed tree while a
multi-file transaction applies. CAS safety is guaranteed only for cooperating
transaction-API writers; concurrent external edits are unsupported and detected
best-effort.

### Encrypted private-vault backup and validated restore

Install exact Restic `0.19.1`, initialize a repository outside the vault, and keep
its credentials in Restic's standard external environment, protected password file,
or password command. The repository-file must contain exactly one repository location
and no inline password. Create an empty protected staging directory before backup:

```bash
uv run python scripts/private_vault_backup.py backup --staging <empty-staging-dir> --restic-binary <absolute-restic-path> --repository-file <absolute-repository-file>
```

Preserve the returned `snapshot_id` and `manifest_sha256` as the backup receipt. The
plaintext staging image is removed after Restic finishes. Backup refuses live or
unknown owners, source races, invalid Reliability-v3 state, corrupt databases,
overlapping repository/staging paths, partial Restic exit, or failed repository check.

The image holds what Git does not: the knowledge, the runtime databases, every
untracked file, and any tracked file you have modified since the last commit. A
tracked file identical to `HEAD` is left out — a clone brings it back — and so are
`cache/`, `logs/`, `run/` (staged separately), `.git/`, `.venv/`, and tool caches such
as `__pycache__`, `.pytest_cache`, `.ruff_cache`, `.mypy_cache` and `node_modules`. A
vault that is not a git checkout, or a machine without `git`, is backed up whole.
Recovery is therefore: clone the repository, install, restore, publish.

Restore only to a pre-existing empty directory:

```bash
uv run python scripts/private_vault_backup.py restore --target <empty-restore-dir> --restic-binary <absolute-restic-path> --repository-file <absolute-repository-file> --snapshot-id <64-hex-id> --manifest-sha256 <64-hex-digest>
```

Restore verifies the exact receipt, canonical manifest, every file/link member, both
SQLite schemas and integrity, and Reliability-v3 ownership projections. Failure
clears restored plaintext; success leaves validated `vault/` and `state/` directories
for reviewed recovery. This command never overwrites or automatically publishes into
an installed vault.

Putting a restored image into an installed vault is a separate, explicit step:

```bash
uv run python scripts/private_vault_backup.py publish --image <restore-dir> --manifest-sha256 <64-hex-digest>
```

Publish validates the image again, then writes only files that are absent from the
vault named by `LLM_WIKI_ROOT` / `LLM_WIKI_STATE_ROOT`. A destination that exists with
different bytes refuses the whole publication before anything is written, and the
refusal names the file by its place in the image (for example
`vault/knowledge/notes/page.md`). Nothing is merged or overwritten, and there is no
force flag. Symlinks and empty directories are not written; the receipt counts them as
`unpublished_entries`.

### Queue migration and work

```bash
uv run python scripts/memory_queue.py work --max-tasks 20 --max-seconds 600 --idle-seconds 2 --lease-seconds 120 --heartbeat-seconds 40 --max-attempts 8 --retry-base-seconds 30 --retry-cap-seconds 3600
uv run python scripts/memory_queue.py redrive <task-id>
uv run python scripts/memory_queue.py unblock <task-id>
uv run python scripts/memory_queue.py purge --terminal-before <ISO-8601> --export <path>
uv run python scripts/memory_queue.py purge --terminal-before <ISO-8601> --export <path> --include-dead
uv run python scripts/memory_queue.py restore --export <path>
```

A `run/queue/` directory left by a release before v4.0.0 (the file-per-task JSON
queue) is refused and named by `doctor`, never imported. The queue is priority/FIFO and at least once, not exactly-once;
handlers rely on stable operation IDs. Defaults are priority 0 in `-100..100`, a
120-second lease with 40-second heartbeat, 8 attempts, 30/3600-second full-jitter
retry base/cap, and worker bounds of 20 tasks, 600 seconds, or 2 idle seconds.
`redrive` creates a linked new task without resetting dead history. `purge` requires
a terminal cutoff and verified export path before deleting terminal rows/results.
Succeeded and cancelled results default to 30 days. A dead task — one whose attempts
are exhausted — is kept until you ask for it by name with `--include-dead`, because it
is evidence that work never happened. `restore --export <path>` reads one export back,
verifies its manifest and every digest, and re-enqueues the work as new ready tasks;
it refuses the whole export if anything fails to verify.

### Daily archive and claims

```bash
uv run python scripts/archive_daily.py --commit --hot-days 90
uv run python benchmark/run_contradiction_benchmark.py --corpus benchmark/contradiction-v1.json
uv run python benchmark/run_flush_classification.py --corpus benchmark/flush-classification-v1.json
```

The weekly pass runs this archiver itself (step `daily_archive`), so the hot window
holds without anyone typing the command; running it by hand does the same work.
The archive moves, never deletes, eligible daily logs older than the 90-day hot
window. A source remains flat if its compile receipt, terminal operations, queue
preflight, exact evidence, or pins do not validate. Published BagIt bags are immutable
and uncompressed; logical evidence resolves from the flat file first and then a
verified bag. There is no gzip archive tier. Claims with invalid evidence, evaluator
disagreement, unsupported semantics, or low confidence enter
`knowledge/inbox/claims/` quarantine. A batch that quarantines publishes the
candidate only, no page: the compile prints `batch quarantined`, records
`last_compile_outcome: quarantined` (or `partial` when other batches published),
and the daily stays pending, so the next run retries it. The batch is atomic:
an independent decision in the same daily is not published on its own. There is
no accept command for a candidate; review it, then publish the decision as a
page through the transaction API, or edit the daily and recompile it with
`compile_memory.py --file`. The candidate and the audit trail are kept. The frozen benchmark reports false
supersession and provenance metrics; automatic semantic supersession and eager
backfill remain disabled.

### Safe runtime deletion

`cache/` and `logs/` are disposable. Do not delete `run/` until `doctor` reports no
nonterminal, conflicted, quarantined, or source failure transaction; no transaction
inside the 2-day undo window; no retained queue task/result or legacy queue artifact;
   and no live project lease, writer, queue worker, maintenance owner, or LSP owner;
   retained LSP failure evidence also blocks deletion. Deleting an
otherwise eligible `run/` loses undo history. Installers and repair commands never
remove it automatically. The system also performs no automatic Git operation and
provides no persistent daemon, cloud service, remote queue/cache, or SQLite knowledge
source.

### Skills (agent-side workflows)

## Optional: semantic search (BM25 + Vector)

For hybrid search that finds semantically related pages even when keywords
don't match:

```bash
uv sync --extra semantic
```

This installs `sentence-transformers`; the encoder is `intfloat/multilingual-e5-small`
— 384 dimensions over 100 languages, so a question in one language reaches a page
written in another. The English-only model it replaces scored every candidate alike
on non-English questions. The weights themselves (0.5 GB, plus 2.2 GB for the
reranker below) are fetched by one explicit, verified step that the installer and
the nightly pass run for you and that you can run by hand:

```bash
uv run python scripts/install_models.py          # fetch what is missing, verify
uv run python scripts/install_models.py --check  # report only
```

Each model is fetched at its pinned commit, only the files the loaders read,
and `model.safetensors` is checked against the size and SHA-256 recorded beside
the revision; a file that does not match is removed and the command fails.
Present files are never fetched again. Without the semantic extra the command
exits 3 (not applicable), and the nightly pass reports its model step as
`skipped`, not failed. Until the weights are there, `doctor`
reports `models: degraded` with that command and search stays lexical.
A first query in a fresh process loads the model: measured on one host, about
11 s for a cold CLI query against 4.5 s lexical-only, while the MCP server loads
it once and answers warm afterwards. Prefer the MCP tools for repeated questions.
Vectors live inside the active evidence generation
(`cache/evidence-graph/generations/<id>/`, beside its search index), and
are built by a generation refresh — the nightly maintenance pass, or
`uv run python scripts/doctor.py --repair` — not at install and not when a
page changes. Until a refresh has run with the model installed, `doctor`
reports `vector_state: absent` and search stays lexical. (Issue #29.)

## Reranker (on by default)

After the lexical and dense legs are fused, a multilingual cross-encoder,
`BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3` at a pinned revision, reads the question together
with each of the ten best candidates and reorders them. It is on by default
since 2026-09-10: on the cross-lingual corpus it takes a Russian question over
English pages from MRR 0.60 to 0.98, where swapping the embedding model gained
at most 0.04 (`docs/research/2026-09-10-cross-lingual-memory-world-practice.md`).

- The MCP server loads it once at start-up (about 2 s, quantised to int8 on the
  CPU) and keeps it resident; a question then pays only the scoring, about 2 s
  for ten passages on four quiet cores and up to 3.5 s on loaded ones. The
  trace reports `reranker_applied`, `reranker_depth` and `reranker_duration_ms`.
- The CLI reranks only when asked with `--rerank`: a one-shot process cannot
  amortise the load.
- Weights are read from the local Hugging Face cache only, like the embedding
  model's; `scripts/install_models.py` puts them there (see above). Without
  them the trace says `reranker_unavailable` and the fused order stands.
- `LLMWIKI_RERANKER_MODEL=off` switches it off; `LLMWIKI_RERANKER_MODEL` plus a
  40-hex `LLMWIKI_RERANKER_REVISION` name another model.
  `LLMWIKI_RERANKER_PRECISION=fp32` restores full precision at twice the time.

## Troubleshooting

### "Nothing happens after install"
- Verify env vars: `echo $LLM_WIKI_ROOT` / `echo $LLM_WIKI_STATE_ROOT`
- Check runtime dirs exist: `cache/`, `logs/`, `run/`; `queue.sqlite3` is created on demand
- Run `uv run python scripts/lookup_mode.py` — it shows vault state

### "Compile never runs"
- Compile triggers only on FLUSH_MAJOR sessions after
  `MEMORY_COMPILE_AFTER_HOUR` (default 18:00). Override or run manually:
  `uv run python scripts/compile_memory.py`
- Check `run/state.json` for `compiled_daily_hashes` and `last_compile_status`

### "Search returns nothing"
- See what the search reads: `uv run python scripts/search_memory.py --status`
  (the active generation; without one, Markdown directly)
- Check health and rebuild the generation: `uv run python scripts/doctor.py`,
  then `uv run python scripts/doctor.py --repair`
- `search_memory.py --rebuild` rebuilds the evidence generation, the one index

### "Hook errors"
- Check `logs/hook-errors.log` for captured exceptions
- All hooks exit 0 on any error (never break your session), so errors are
  silent unless you check the log

### "Tests fail on fresh clone"
- Run `uv sync --locked --extra mcp-server` first (the installed baseline includes MCP)
- `uv run pytest -q` — inspect the current full regression status and reported failures
- If collection or imports fail, update the checkout and rerun `uv sync --locked --dev`
