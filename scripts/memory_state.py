"""Shared helpers for memory automation state.

Three-zone layout: vault holds code + knowledge + gitignored runtime dirs.

    <vault>/
      run/state.json     # compile hashes, dedupe, heartbeats
      run/compile.pid    # maybe_compile lock
      run/queue-v3.sqlite3   # deferred LLM tasks

      cache/             # FTS5/vector/graph indexes (cache/cognee/ is retired)

`cache/`, `logs/`, `run/` are gitignored — they live inside the
vault for single-checkout portability but git never tracks their churn.
Override the root via LLM_WIKI_STATE_ROOT (tests use a temp dir).

Written by multiple concurrent processes (flush_memory and compile_memory
may run at the same time). All writers MUST go through `update_state(mutator)`
so the mutation is applied on top of the latest on-disk version under a
cross-platform file lock — otherwise a slow writer will clobber fields
written by a faster one.
