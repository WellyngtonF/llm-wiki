"""Collect the evidence-graph generations nothing reads any more.

`CLAUDE.md` calls `cache/` disposable and regenerable, and every published
generation is immutable after activation. Neither sentence collected anything:
the only removal path the product had, `GenerationCatalog.discard_unactivated`,
refuses any generation that was ever activated, which on a vault that builds
nightly is all of them but one. Measured here on 2026-08-29: 35 registered
generations, 6.3 GB, the oldest from 2026-08-21, growing about 180 MB a night.

What is kept is reachability from the active pointer, not an age window. The
active generation is the one thing anything reads — retrieval resolves the
pointer, and the incremental rebuild names the active generation as its reuse
parent — and one ancestor is kept behind it, because that ancestor is the first
alternative `_fallback_order` offers when the active tree stops validating. The
depth is `generation_catalog.RETAINED_ANCESTOR_GENERATIONS`, which carries the
reason. Everything else is dropped: registration, activation history and the
directory together, inside the catalog's own write transaction.

What this pass refuses to decide. A registration whose tree is missing is the
residue of an interrupted operation and is reported, never removed (unless it was
superseded: then it is a discard whose commit was lost, and it is completed). A
tree with no registration is reported as an orphan; the doctor's repair removes it
once no writer has touched it for a day. A registration that has never been
activated is either an abandoned publication or one in flight; one whose tree no
writer has touched for a day is abandoned and removed through
`discard_unactivated`, and a younger one is left pending. See
`docs/research/2026-09-14-an-abandoned-publication-is-collected.md`. A code
generation is never activated by design and is never abandoned: see
`docs/research/2026-09-15-a-code-generation-is-not-abandoned.md`. It is named as
a code generation, not as pending: it waits on no activation, and repository
retention, which knows its readers, retires it.
