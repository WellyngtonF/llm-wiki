"""Flush one session event into knowledge/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md.

Run as a detached background process by PreCompact / SessionEnd hooks.

Responsibilities:
1. Read the transcript at `--transcript` (JSONL Claude Code transcript).
2. Ask the unified llm_client (auto-detected backend: OpenCode / Codex /
   Claude CLI / OpenAI / Ollama) to classify + summarize the session
   into one of three tiers (Phase 0.5 upgrade):
     - FLUSH_MAJOR: decisions/lessons/non-obvious commands worth compiling
     - FLUSH_MINOR: only gotchas/debug-notes/open-questions — save but no auto-compile
     - FLUSH_OK:    pure status/progress chatter — skip entirely
3. For MAJOR/MINOR: append the structured summary to today's daily log
   with an `[HH:MM:SS] event | session_id` header block and a `Tier:`
   metadata line. For OK: do not append anything.
4. Dedupe: skip if the same (session_id, event) was flushed in the last 60s.
5. If local time >= MEMORY_COMPILE_AFTER_HOUR (default 18) AND tier is
   MAJOR AND today's daily log changed since last compile: spawn
   compile via `maybe_compile` (PID-locked). (MINOR no longer triggers
   compile — this prevents the compile pipeline from churning on
   sessions that contain only minor gotchas.)

The 3-tier scale replaces the previous binary FLUSH_OK/no-FLUSH_OK.
Empirically the old threshold was too aggressive (12 consecutive
empty flushes recorded in state.json as of 2026-04-23): the LLM
returned FLUSH_OK for any session that lacked a clean "decisions"
section, even when useful gotchas or commands were present.

State lives in $LLM_WIKI_STATE_ROOT/run/state.json (default:
$LLM_WIKI_ROOT/run/state.json — inside the vault, gitignored) so git
doesn't track runtime churn.

Event: {event}

=== STEP 1 — CLASSIFY ===
First, decide the tier of this session by scanning the transcript:

- FLUSH_MAJOR  — contains at least one of: a concrete DECISION with
  rationale, a reusable LESSON/pattern, or a non-obvious COMMAND/snippet
  worth remembering across sessions.

- FLUSH_MINOR  — contains only one or more of: a debug GOTCHA
  (symptom→cause), an OPEN QUESTION worth returning to, or a single
  useful observation — but no decisions or lessons. Worth saving but
  not worth auto-compiling.

- FLUSH_OK     — pure status/progress chatter ("we did X", "started Y",
  "fixed Z" without explanation). Nothing a future session would benefit
  from. Empty transcripts and pure-navigation turn here too.

Be strict. Status updates are FLUSH_OK even if they mention real work —
the bar is "would a future session in this project benefit from knowing
this?". When in doubt, choose the lower tier.

=== STEP 2 — DISTILL (skip for FLUSH_OK) ===
For FLUSH_MAJOR and FLUSH_MINOR, produce a Markdown block with ONLY
these sections that apply (skip empty sections):

- **Decisions made** — concrete choices with reasons (MAJOR only).
- **Lessons / patterns** — reusable insights (MAJOR only).
- **Commands / snippets** — non-obvious invocations (any tier).
- **Gotchas / debugging** — symptom → cause → fix (any tier).
- **Open questions** — unresolved, worth returning to (any tier).

Be terse. Each bullet should fit on one line. Do NOT narrate what was
done — that is status, not memory.

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===
Emit EXACTLY one of these tokens as the FIRST line of your response,
followed by a blank line, then (if MAJOR/MINOR) the distilled block:

For MAJOR:
FLUSH_MAJOR

<distilled markdown block>

For MINOR:
FLUSH_MINOR

<distilled markdown block>

For OK (no second line allowed):
FLUSH_OK

Do not add preamble, apologies, or trailing explanation. The first
non-blank line MUST be the tier token.
