"""User-level SessionStart hook — inject per-project state.md.

This hook fires on every Claude Code session start, regardless of cwd. It
resolves the current project's slug, reads (or creates) the corresponding
`knowledge/projects/<slug>/state.md`, and emits its content as additionalContext
so Claude starts the session knowing where we left off in this project.

Companion to the project-level `session_start_context.py` hook (which
injects general memory context when cwd=vault). Both can fire in the same
session without conflict — Claude Code runs all registered hooks and
concatenates their additionalContext output.

Contract (hard requirements):
    * Must exit 0 on ANY error. Breaking a session is worse than missing
      context. All exceptions are swallowed and logged to
      $LLM_WIKI_STATE_ROOT/hook-errors.log (best-effort).
    * Must no-op if LLM_WIKI_ROOT is unset or its knowledge/projects/ is missing.
    * Output: a single JSON object on stdout with the shape Claude Code
      expects (see schema: hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext).

Slug rule (mirrors `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and
[[Global Multi-Project Migration Plan]]):
    0. CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR (or cwd) first resolves to its repository's main
       checkout (`repository_identity`); every step below reads that.
    1. Base: lowercase basename of the main checkout with
       whitespace and unsafe chars replaced by hyphens. Non-ASCII chars
       (e.g. Cyrillic) are preserved — NTFS and Obsidian both handle them.
    2. On collision (another project recorded a different root under the
       same slug): append parent-of-parent (e.g. `backend` + `your-app`
       → `backend-your-app`).
    3. On further collision: parse the origin URL from `.git/config` and
       use `owner-repo`.
    4. On further collision: append the grandparent folder name.
    5. Last resort: append a deterministic 6-char SHA-256 suffix of the
       absolute project path — guaranteed unique.
    Ownership is determined by strict match of the `- Project root:` line
    in the existing `state.md`. A state.md without that line is treated
    as NOT ours (forces disambiguation; worst case is a hash-suffixed
    slug, safer than cross-contamination).
