"""Durable diagnostics for capture hooks — a lost capture must leave a trace.

Prompt and post-tool capture are best-effort by design: they must never break
the user's session, so every failure path returns quietly. Silence is not the
same as safety. A capture that fails without a record is indistinguishable
from a session that had nothing worth capturing, and the loss is invisible to
the user and to maintenance alike.

Every failure lands here:

* one bounded JSONL trail (`logs/capture-failures.jsonl`) carrying the reason,
* one counter per failure kind in `state.json` for the health surfaces.

Both are bounded: the trail is trimmed to the newest entries under a byte cap,
and the counter map keeps the most recent kinds only. Recording is itself
best-effort — diagnostics must never become the reason a hook fails.
