"""Turn a day of session records into durable knowledge, in the idle window.

Sessions are kept verbatim (`knowledge/raw/sessions/`), but keeping is not
remembering: nothing reads them, so nothing becomes a page. The 2026 survey of
agent memory lists principled consolidation as the first open frontier and
describes the shape this vault already has half of — raw episodes in a hot
buffer, promoted to durable storage only after validation. Letta reports 18%
higher accuracy and 2.5x lower cost per query from moving that work off the query
path; here it runs in the nightly pass, where nobody is waiting.

Promotion is validated, not trusted: every item the model returns must quote a
line that really occurs in one of the day's records, or it is dropped. What
survives is appended to the daily log as one entry, and the existing compile
pipeline — with its receipts, transactions and DLP boundary — turns it into
pages. There is no second writer.

See knowledge/notes/session-evidence-retention-decision.md (MEM-02).
