"""Nightly consolidation pass — started at 03:00 by the installed scheduler.

The scheduler is Task Scheduler on Windows, a user LaunchAgent on macOS, a
user systemd timer on Linux, cron as the explicit degraded fallback
(`install_control.py`). The pass runs, in order: capture-intent adoption,
runtime reclaim, the deferred memory queue, yesterday's session
consolidation; the compile (spawned through `maybe_compile`, followed until
it finishes or the wait bound passes) and user-turn keying; then the steps
that read the compile's output — the note index and project pages,
orphaned-checkpoint clearing, structural lint, the FTS5 index,
registered-repository refresh, generation pruning, model weights, the bounded generation refresh —
telemetry compaction, the health report, report pruning and the bounded
fast-forward of the checkout. Never requires user interaction. All output
goes to $LLM_WIKI_STATE_ROOT/logs/nightly-YYYY-MM-DD.md.
