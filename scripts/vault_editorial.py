"""Shared definitions of editorial/metadata page sets across the vault.

Multiple scripts need to distinguish **editorial metadata** pages from
**curated content** pages:

- `lint_memory.py` exempts editorial pages from orphan and sparse
  checks.
- `lookup_mode.py` excludes editorial pages from the curated-page
  counter that chooses the retrieval tier.

Before this module these lived as duplicate literals, drifting over
time. Centralizing them here keeps the two callers in sync and gives
new scripts a single import point.

## Conventions

`EDITORIAL_NAMES` — filenames whose presence in *any* path under the
vault marks the page as editorial. Matching is by basename, case-sensitive.

`BROKEN_LINK_SKIP_NAMES` — pages whose prose frequently contains literal
`[[...]]` that aren't real wikilinks (docs with bracket placeholders,
append-only changelogs with historical references to renamed pages).

`editorial_parents_to_skip()` — directories to skip wholesale when
enumerating content (e.g. `knowledge/projects/_template/` is a skeleton).

## What NOT to put here

Purely script-internal helpers (path resolution, state I/O) stay in
`memory_state.py`. This module is editorial policy only.
