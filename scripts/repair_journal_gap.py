"""Append a committed sequence the journal does not carry.

`ProjectJournalRebuildRequired` says in its own docstring that append-only
ordering needs an explicit verified rebuild, and until now there was none. A
sequence the coordinator calls committed while the journal ends before it stops
every later sequence for that project, permanently.

That state is not supposed to arise, and on this vault it arose because of a
change of mine that was reverted an hour later: `llm-wiki` 1429 was settled as
committed without its entry being written. The journal is the authority, so such
a row is a false record and its write is still owed.

The walk is deliberately narrow. Starting at the journal head, a sequence is
appended only when all three hold: the coordinator has a committed row at
exactly `head + 1`, the journal carries no record with that sequence, and the
project lease is held. It stops at the first sequence that fails any of them, so
it can never reorder a journal, never skip a sequence, and never append one the
journal already has. On a vault with no gap it does nothing.

See `docs/research/2026-08-30-a-sequence-nothing-can-settle.md`.
