"""Reclaim what the hook path is too impatient to finish.

Two jobs, both of them recovery rather than routine work, and both of them
impossible from a session hook:

**Drain the project-checkpoint backlog.** A hook drains with a 0.5 s state-lock
budget because a person is waiting on it. That is correct, and it is also why a
backlog outlives every hook: measured on this vault 2026-08-30, `run/state.json`
had grown to 6.7 MB, hooks held the lock almost continuously, and eight
consecutive forced drains each lost it in 0.6 s with the queue unmoved at 2 485
checkpoints. This pass is unattended, so it can wait properly, and it is bounded
so it can never hang the nightly run.

**Sweep abandoned state temporaries.** `atomic_write` stages content in
`.<name>.<nonce>.tmp`, fsyncs it, then renames. A process killed in between —
a hook that hit its timeout, most often — leaves the staged file forever and
nothing collects it. Measured the same day: 39 orphans, 272 MB, every one of
them complete JSON, the oldest from 08-26. Only files older than an hour are
removed, which no live write can be, and the nonce means a sweep can never
race a writer for a name it is about to use.
