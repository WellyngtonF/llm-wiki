"""Re-attempt checkpoints whose names no request can produce any more.

A quarantined or reserved checkpoint sequence blocks every sequence behind it,
and the design clears it the right way: the original request arrives again,
re-derives the same `occurrence_id`, and `_retry_spent_checkpoint` turns the row
into a fresh attempt. `tests/test_project_journal.py` states that contract in
seven tests and nothing here changes it.

On 2026-08-30 a batch's `occurrence_id` stopped being its last event's id and
became a digest of the whole batch, because two batches ending at the same event
were claiming one name and the second was refused forever. That fix left behind
rows named under the old scheme. No future request can bear those names, so for
those rows alone the door the design left open is walled up — and on this vault
three of them were holding 3 338 queued checkpoints, one of them the only
surviving record of 40 events.

This walks exactly those rows: not committed, and named by something other than
the batch naming. It takes the project lease, gives each a fresh attempt through
the same step a returning request would have used, and replays it. On a vault
with no orphaned names it does nothing and says so. Running it twice is safe.

See `docs/research/2026-08-30-a-sequence-nothing-can-settle.md`.
