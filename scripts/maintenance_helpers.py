"""Shared helpers for scheduled maintenance scripts (nightly / weekly).

Both ``scheduled_nightly.py`` and ``scheduled_weekly.py`` need the same
subprocess-step runner and compile-idle waiter. Extracted here to avoid
the prior copy-paste duplication.

Two contracts live here that the reports depend on:

* **Step output is never held in memory.** A step writes straight to an
  owner-only artifact under ``logs/maintenance/``; the report keeps a short
  summary and always names the artifact holding the full output, so a
  truncated line is never the end of the trail.
* **Maintenance output has bounded retention.** ``prune_reports`` enforces
  age, count, and total size over the report and artifact files, so an
  unattended machine cannot fill its disk with its own diagnostics.
