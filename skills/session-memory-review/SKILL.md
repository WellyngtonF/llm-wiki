Review `$ARGUMENTS` if provided, otherwise review the whole knowledge subsystem (`knowledge/daily/`, `knowledge/notes/`).

Procedure:
1. **Structural pass (scripted):**
   Run `uv run python scripts/lint_memory.py --structural-only`.
   The script writes a report to `$LLM_WIKI_STATE_ROOT/logs/lint-YYYY-MM-DD.md` covering:
   - broken wikilinks across `knowledge/notes/`
   - orphan knowledge pages (not referenced from the relevant `index.md`)
   - orphan daily logs (not yet compiled)
   - stale compiled pages (daily hash drifted after last compile)
   - sparse pages (under 200 words by default; configurable via `--sparse-words`)
   - opt-in LLM-judged contradictions via `--contradictions`

2. **LLM review pass (over the scripted findings):**
   Read the lint report, then answer:
   - Are there duplicate or near-duplicate decision/pattern pages that should be merged?
   - Are debugging pages turning into stale incident notes that should be archived?
   - Are there recurring themes across multiple daily logs that have not yet been lifted into knowledge?
   - Are there weak links between `knowledge/daily/` (or `knowledge/projects/`) and `knowledge/notes/` that would benefit from `bridge-promote-insight`?

Return:
- concise health report summarizing the structural findings
- top 5 cleanup or promotion actions (ordered by impact)
- exact files involved
