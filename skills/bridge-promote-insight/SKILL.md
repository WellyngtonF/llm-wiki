Use this when an insight discovered during coding/work sessions deserves to become part of the broader research wiki.

Procedure:
1. Read the relevant page(s) from `knowledge/notes/`.
2. Decide whether the insight belongs in:
   - `knowledge/notes/` as a concept page
   - `knowledge/notes/` as a decision page
   - `knowledge/notes/` as a pattern page
   - `knowledge/notes/` as a debugging page
   - `knowledge/notes/` as a qa page
   - or only as a cross-link from existing pages.
3. Create or update the target wiki page. Required elements on the new wiki page:
   - standard wiki frontmatter + `One-sentence summary:` line
   - a `## Source` block that names the memory origin page explicitly, e.g.:
     > Origin: session memory — `knowledge/notes/<slug>` (distilled from `knowledge/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` [HH:MM:SS]).
   - a closing paragraph stating *"This page is a **promotion from session memory**, not a compilation of external source material."* — tells future readers why there is no `knowledge/raw/` citation.
4. Add a `## Promoted to wiki` section to the **memory origin page** (append, don't replace earlier content). Format:
   ```
   ## Promoted to wiki
   Promoted YYYY-MM-DD to [[Wiki Page Title]] (`knowledge/notes/`). This memory page remains as <reason — usually "the dated decision record" or "the fuller origin story">; the wiki page is the concise public-facing <concept/convention/definition>.
   ```
   Then add the wiki page as the first entry in the memory page's `## Related` section.
5. Confirm the wiki page's `## Related` names the memory origin page with a bare `[[<slug>]]` wikilink, so the promotion reads from both sides. Do not write "links to this page" lines anywhere else: Obsidian derives backlinks.
6. Register the new wiki page in `knowledge/index.md` under the correct section (Concepts / Decisions / Patterns / Debugging / Q&A) and append a dated entry to `knowledge/log.local.md` describing the promotion and citing the memory origin.

Return:
- path of the created or updated wiki page
- path of the memory origin page now carrying the `## Promoted to wiki` marker
- one-line rationale for the target section choice

Anti-patterns:
- Don't delete the memory page after promoting — its date-stamped record stays as provenance.
- Don't paste the memory content verbatim into wiki — rephrase in third-person for a reader without session context.
- Don't skip step 4; without the reciprocal marker `lint_memory.py` will flag the memory page as having lost a connection, and future promotions won't find the precedent.
