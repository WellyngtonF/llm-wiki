"""The orphan check must not demand what the index generator removes.

`rebuild_memory_index` drops superseded and archived pages from the navigation
map on purpose. While the orphan check still reported those pages as missing
from it, the two rules could not both hold, and `orphan_pages` is a blocking
category in CI — so the build had no green state available to it.
