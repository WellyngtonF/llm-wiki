"""A project is a directory the owner could be working in; the corpus holds its claim pages.

The audit of 2026-09-23 found 85 project directories on the live vault, minted for a
benchmark run under `cache/`, a transaction directory under `run/`, the provider's temp
directory, a pytest temp directory, the home directory and the vault itself — and found
that their journals were 94 % of the search index's bytes. See
`docs/research/2026-09-23-the-corpus-is-the-claim-pages-and-a-project-is-a-project.md`.

Since issue #14 a directory also has to be registered to have work state; these
refusals stand before the map is read, so no map entry can make one a project.
