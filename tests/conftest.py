"""Shared pytest fixtures and environment bootstrap.

Makes the suite **hermetic** — runs green from a fresh clone without
any pre-set environment variables or pre-existing runtime state.

  1. Subprocess-invoked hooks read `LLM_WIKI_ROOT`; absent env → no-op.
  2. State must not pollute the developer's real runtime (production
     lives inside the vault under gitignored `cache/logs/run/`). Tests
     redirect `LLM_WIKI_STATE_ROOT` to a session-scoped pytest temp dir.

Override: set `LLM_WIKI_STATE_ROOT` before pytest AND
`LLM_WIKI_TEST_USE_EXTERNAL_STATE=1` if you need a custom location.

# writes into their memory. By 2026-08-24 that had left 384 project journals from
# past pytest sessions in `knowledge/projects`, and they were coming back as
# answers to real questions. The guard makes the next one impossible to miss.
# What a test may not do is leave knowledge behind in this checkout, which has
# been the owner's live vault since the two directories merged on 2026-08-21. By
# 2026-08-24 that had left 384 project journals from past pytest sessions, and
# they were coming back as answers to real questions.
#
# The watch is deliberately uneven, because the live runtime writes here too:
#   * `knowledge/projects` is compared by name only — a real session working in
#     `project-beta` or `project-alpha` appends to its own journal while the suite runs,
#     and that is the owner's work, not a leak. A leaking test creates a project
#     of its own, which shows up as a new name.
#   * `knowledge/notes` is compared file by file — only a nightly compile writes
#     there, so any change during a run is worth stopping for.
#   * `knowledge/raw/sessions` is compared file by file too, since 2026-08-26.
#     Leaving it unwatched cost three fixture session records — `session-1.md`
#     under 2026-08-24, -25 and -26 — written by `tests/test_flush_classification`
#     through the pinned root while only `flush_memory.STATE_ROOT` was patched.
#     A record is a whole file that is never rewritten, so file-by-file is the
#     same watch as notes. The accepted cost: a genuine capture finishing while
#     the suite runs trips the guard too. The message names the path, and a real
#     record names a real session id, so the two are told apart by looking.
#   * `knowledge/daily` is still not watched at all: the capture appends to
#     today's log continuously, measured mid-run today.
